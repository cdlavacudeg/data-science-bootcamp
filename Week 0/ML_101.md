# Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?
- Machine learning provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
- It allow computers to discover hidden and useful insights
- In nutshell, Machine Learning is a new way of communicating
your wishes to a computer.

## Machine Learning is used in..
- Fraud detection - Eg: Credit card fraud detection. It will help us to detect whether a transaction is fraud or not.
- Email spam filtering - Eg: Helps in categorising whether a particular email should go in inbox or spam box.
- Recommendation engines - Eg: E-commerce platforms like Amazon can recommend you a similar product based on your
previously browsed list of products
- and many more!!

## What is a Machine Learning (ML) model?
For now, let's consider it is a magical box that help us to predict what we want.

### Key words
- Features or variables: These are the most common terms that we would come across from now on. Features and variables both are the same in a datase, they are often interchangeably used. So there is no need to worry about it!
- Target/Label varible: The target variable or label of a dataset is the feature of a dataset about which you want to gain a deeper understanding. It is the variable that is, or should be the output.
- Predictor/Input variables: The target variable or label of a dataset is the feature of a dataset
about which you want to gain a deeper understanding.
It is the variable that is, or should be the output.
- Dependent and independent variables:So far you've been studying input and output/target variables.Commonly, the input variable is known as independent variable and target variable is known as dependent variable.   

In nutshell, our target variable is nothing but a dependent variable. Why dependent? Because the values of this variable are dependent on other variables (i.e. input variables) And, our input variables are known as independent variables.Here the values of these variables are not dependent on any other variables.

### Train and test set
Data acquisition -> Data Cleaning ->Train ->Train model -> Test Model
                                  -> Test -------------------â†‘
We need to test machine learning models on unseen data or test data.Otherwise, we have no way of knowing whether the algorithm has learned a generalizable pattern or has simply memorized the training data.

- TRAINING DATA: The observations in the training set form the experience that the algorithm uses to learn.
- TEST DATA: The test set is a set of observations used to evaluate the
performance of the model using some performance metric.

It is important that no observations from the training set are
included in the test set. If the test set does contain examples
from the training set, it will be difficult to assess whether the
algorithm has learned to generalize from the training set or has
simply memorized it.

#### Train test split
Consider an Example where our Original Dataset has 1000 rows. When we start building our ML model we will split our dataset into two parts (70% train data and 30% test data).

We will train our model on 70% of data i.e 700 rows and then test our model performance on 30% of data i.e 300 rows. As discussed above while testing our model we will not provide the outcome to our model for the test data although we know the outcome and instead let our model give us the outcome for those 300 rows.

Later we will compare the outcome of our model to the original outcome of our test data to get the accuracy of our model predictions.

For splitting our data to training and testing set we use **train_test_split**
method of **scikit-learn library**.

## Types of algorithms

### Supervised Learning Algorithms

Let's talk about the datasets that have both input variables and target variables (labels for the data). Ranging from predicting the survival rate of a person in Titanic Dataset where Survival Rate is already given to predicting the House Price according to house characteristics where the house prices are provided.

The algorithms that work on such datasets are known as **Supervised Learning Algorithms**.

It is called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process.*We know the correct answers*, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.

#### Types of supervised learning algorithms

##### Classification
The target variable is divided into classes. You'll be using Classification.

When the number of classes is 2, it is known as Binary Classification. Eg. Will it be hot or cold tomorrow is a binary classification problem with 2 classes: Hot and Cold.

When it is more than 2, it is known as Multi Class Classification. Eg. Classifying movies in Good, Average or Bad according to reviews.

##### Regression
 This means that if you're trying to predict quantities like height, income, price, or scores, you should be using a model that will output a continuous number.

So if your objective is to determine tomorrow's temperature,you should use a regression model.

### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

Unsupervised learning is where you have unlabeled data (or no target variable) in the dataset. The goal of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms is to find some structure in the dataset. These are called **unsupervised learning** because unlike supervised learning, there are no correct answers and there is no teacher. Algorithms are *left to their own* to discover and present the interesting structure in the data.
